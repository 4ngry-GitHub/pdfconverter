# PDF to MP3 Converter

This repository contains two Python scripts: `pdf_handler.py` and `gui.py`.

`gui.py` is a simple Python program with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to convert PDF files to MP3 files. It uses the `PySimpleGUI` library for creating the GUI.

### Prerequisites:

- Python 3.10 or above
- `PySimpleGUI` library
- `tkinter` library

### Usage:

To use `gui.py`, you can run the following command:python src/gui.py

The GUI will open, allowing you to choose a PDF file and specify the output MP3 file. Once you click the "Convert" button, the PDF file will be converted to an MP3 file and saved in the same directory as the script.

## Requirements:

To install the required libraries, you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

You can then install the required libraries using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Test Data:

I've also provided you with some PDF samples.
One is a small file and another is "Gang of Four" book in .pdf format.

The samples are located in:

```
./media
```
